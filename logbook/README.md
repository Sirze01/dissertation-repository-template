# Logbook directory
During the course of your dissertation, you will have to meet with your supervisor(s) and other people. This directory is intended to save your meeting notes so you don't forget any of their feedback, suggestions, requests or decisions. You can also log here the progress of your tasks and writing.

Use something like [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to make taking notes fast and easy.
